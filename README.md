# Ohmics
Workflows and Pipelines for analyzing biological data. These scripts are adapted to generate fully reproducible responses, with final reports. These files are PDF compiled formats showing:

- Quality report
- Results report

Even as the final aim is the establishment of a fast/replicable tool for results report, guidelines for initial data warehousing are included with minimal reproducible examples.
